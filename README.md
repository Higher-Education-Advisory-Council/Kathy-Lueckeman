The repository is provided on “as-is” and “as-available” basis for exclusive use by Kathleen T. Lueckeman, and her designated co-contributors. Although maintained within the Salesforce.org Higher Education Advisory Council repository at GitHub, neither Kathleen T. Lueckeman nor the Salesforce.org Higher Education Advisory Council members make express, implied, or other warranty of any kind regarding the repository. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws, Kathleen T. Lueckeman  disclaims, without limitation, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, freedom from defects, and non-infringement. Salesforce.org has no liability to you or any other party arising from your use of this project repository, including without limitation any liability for direct, indirect, consequential, punitive, special, exemplary, or cover damages, regardless the nature of a claim or theory of liability. The foregoing disclaimer applies even if you advise Kathleen T. Lueckeman and/or the Salesforce.org Higher Education Advisory Council of the possibility of such damages.

The nature of this project is such that active maintenance of this repository is not guaranteed by any other party or entity. Kathleen T. Lueckeman has no obligation to protect the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of said information. Any reference to specific commercial products, or services, other than those services provided by Salesforce.org or Salesforce.com, by reference to trademarks or service marks does not imply any endorsement or recommendation by either Salesforce.org or Salesforce.com. No license to use trademarks or service marks belonging to either Salesforce.org or Salesforce.com is conveyed to you in these terms and conditions.

Some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation of liability for certain types of damages, and thus some of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to particular users of this repository. If these disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations cannot be given local legal effect according to the terms and conditions described herein, you agree that reviewing courts will apply local laws which most closely approximate an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the repository.
